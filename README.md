# Poketan

A little game based on Pokemons and public transports in the city of Nantes. It was made at 4 students in about 6 days

## How to play?

When you come near a bus or tramway stop in Nantes, you can fight a new wild Pokemon and capture it. There is 3 different pokemon to capture per stop (with different rarity), and each time you win a fight your pokemon becomes stronger. 

## Edit
Right now the server is probably down so it won't work even if you're in Nantes...
